# Week 1 – Survival with Clarity (May 6–12, 2025)

## ✅ What Went Well
- Created and launched the **Intrapreneur Undercover** GitHub project.
- Printed and internalized the *Survival Guide* with personal modifications (v4).
- Clarified boundaries: no personal time to compensate for organizational inefficiency.
- Documented a clear, principled response strategy to below-inflation salary offers.
- Began using camera-off meetings to reclaim focus time during shallow rituals.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Truth-telling inside a broken system requires careful language and timing.
- Passive-aggressive praise is risky — better to frame outcomes, not people.
- Strategic silence with blockers preserves energy and prevents escalation.
- ROI documentation isn’t for my current manager — it’s for my future leverage.

## 🧭 Focus for Next Week
- Create and use the **Impact Log** template with Copilot at work.
- Add personal 1/10/20-year goals to the GitHub repo in `docs/goals.md`.
- Start `/weekly-checkins/week-02.md` log and structure.
- Draft first Sprint Review slide that shows “quiet wins” without triggering politics.

## 💬 Quote of the Week
