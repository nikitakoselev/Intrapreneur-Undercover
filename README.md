# Intrapreneur Undercover

A personal framework and toolkit for navigating complex organizations with clarity, integrity, and quiet impact.

## Purpose

This project documents strategies, tools, and mindsets that help individuals contribute meaningfully inside systems where communication, structure, or incentives may not always align with value creation.

## Who is this for?

Anyone who cares deeply about doing great work—even when the environment feels slow, ambiguous, or overly process-driven.

## What's inside

- A survival-style guide for sustainable contribution
- Safe communication strategies for high-integrity professionals
- Templates for tracking impact, preparing for reviews, and reflecting weekly
- A real-time journal of weekly reflections and lessons learned

## Philosophy

Operate with focus. Communicate with care. Align with what matters. Track your value quietly—and build leverage for when the time is right.
