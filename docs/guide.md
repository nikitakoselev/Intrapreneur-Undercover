# 🕶 Intrapreneur Undercover: Survival Guide

This guide is designed to help individuals working in complex or process-heavy environments stay grounded, effective, and aligned with personal values.

## ✅ What To Do
- Participate in required rituals while maintaining personal focus where possible.
- Follow established processes outwardly while quietly improving flow where feasible.
- Track delivery patterns and areas of friction for future improvement.
- Communicate using neutral, non-triggering language.
- Let others shine—focus on impact, not credit.

## 🧭 Mapping Priorities
- Observe what receives fast leadership responses.
- Focus on actions that reduce risk, cost, or support burden.
- Track deliverables that lead to decisions or unblock others.
- Avoid noise: tasks that don’t change systems or decisions.

## ❌ Safer Reframing
| Original | Reframe |
|----------|---------|
| “This process is broken” | “There may be opportunities to improve time-to-value.” |
| “This slows everything down” | “We’re seeing delivery friction here.” |

## 📎 Example Reply for New Requests
> “Happy to support — if this aligns with team goals, I’ll make space.”

## 🗂 Impact Log Template
| Date | Task | Action | Outcome | Value | Notes |
